# weatherApp
Website where you can search any city in the world and it will give the current weather of the city. Does this by accessing the openweather api where
it fetches json data to be used to get the proper weather information. 

Also used the unsplash photo api to do the same thing with weather but with the background photos.

Uses Javascript, Html and CSS
